# Project-03_Online-Registration-Form

In this project I have built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes.
Using the supplied mockup files of the online technology school Teamtreehouse where I am enrolled as Techdegree Student in Front End Web Development, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.
